# Garden of my Mind

Garden of my Mind is a web app built for [Mindfulness Hacks.](https://mindfulness-hacks-sca.devpost.com/)

This project is designed to promote mindfulness and well-being by encouraging users to reflect on their daily actions and virtues. Each mindful act allows users to add to their virtual garden of pixel art flowers, symbolizing their journey toward mental health and balance.

## Features
- Add journal entries describing your daily actions and select a virtue (e.g., gratitude, courage).
- Collect a unique pixel art flower that represents the virtue you practiced.
- View your personal garden of flowers.
- Explore the collection of flowers to learn about different virtues and the flowers they are represented by.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase & Firestore

## Future Improvements
- Add seasonal garden themes (e.g., snow, falling leaves) and special flowers.
- Implement the 'Community' tab, where users can visit other gardens.
- Store journal entries so they can be viewed later.
- Use AI to analyse the journal entry and suggest the virtue automatically.
